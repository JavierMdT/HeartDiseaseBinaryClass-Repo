# HeartDisease---BinaryClassification
I made this project with my classmate for my 'Machine Learning II' course. 
The objective is to predict whether an individual is likely to have heart disease based on their health data.

There are two Jupyter notebooks. The first one is used for pre-processing the data. 
The second one uses two CSV files with the pre-processed data (which we exported, but this step is not included in the code). 
You don’t need to do anything; this information is just in case you don’t understand what we did.
